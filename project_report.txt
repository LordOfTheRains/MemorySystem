11.1)

1) we extracted 16bit from the 32bit input from the input since our ssytem only takes 16bit logical address. then we take the first 8bit as page number and last 8bit as offset.,we search tlb table for the page number, if its a hit then we load the frame number then the physical is framenumber in first 8bit and offset in last 8bit. if the tlb is a miss, we go to page table to lcoate the frame number and do the same operation. if page is also a miss. then we 



2)typedef struct {
    page_t page_num;
    frame_t frame_num;
    bool valid;
} page_entry_t;

typedef struct {
    page_entry_t page_entry[PAGE_TABLE_SIZE];
} page_table_t;


typedef struct {
    page_t page_num;
    frame_t frame_num;
    bool valid;
    age_t age;
    used_t used;
} tlb_entry_t;

typedef struct {
    tlb_entry_t tlb_entry[TLB_SIZE];
    unsigned int next_tlb_ptr;
} tlb_t;


typedef struct {
  byte memory[PHYSICAL_MEM_SIZE];
  int next_byte_ptr;

}physical_mem_t;


3) not yet but close;
4)  page_num = logical_address >> OFFSET_BITS;
    offset = logical_address & OFFSET_MASK;


5) we implemented both FIFO and Least Recent Used that user can select which policy to use at the begining of the program. detail impleemntation is inside tlb.c

11.2)
1) its pretty genral because we can select replacement policy therefore soluciton becomes extensible. all hard coded values are defined inside ssytem.h which can be modified in single spot.
2) it is very simple we have a system.h constant file where you define all system related constant such as page table size.

3) yes

4) no. it is offset as framenum+offset, which are both equal in size since frame number is the same size as page number.

11.3
1) it is as elegant as we can make it. we different modules for related functionalities for readability and nothing is directly hardcoded. constants are in constant file and policies are separated from the mechanism.

2) it is not very innovative since we are only implementing simple replacement policy and nothing thinking about laoding from backing storage either on a need basis or in a pre-fetching fashion.

3) we didnt use except whats provided by Dr.Qin on canvas. which we didnt modify the comments regarding to his name. all other files without author info are made by us.
