11.1)

1) We extracted 16bit from the 32bit input from the input since our system only
 takes 16bit logical address. Then we take the first 8bit as page number
 and last 8bit as offset. We search tlb table for the page number, if its a
 hit then we load the frame number then the physical is framenumber in first
 8bit and offset in last 8bit. If the tlb is a miss, we go to page table to
 locate the frame number and do the same operation. If page is also a miss.



2)typedef struct {
    page_t page_num;
    frame_t frame_num;
    bool valid;
} page_entry_t;

typedef struct {
    page_entry_t page_entry[PAGE_TABLE_SIZE];
} page_table_t;


typedef struct {
    page_t page_num;
    frame_t frame_num;
    bool valid;
    age_t age;
    used_t used;
} tlb_entry_t;

typedef struct {
    tlb_entry_t tlb_entry[TLB_SIZE];
    unsigned int next_tlb_ptr;
} tlb_t;


typedef struct {
  byte memory[PHYSICAL_MEM_SIZE];
  frame_t next_frame_ptr;

}physical_mem_t;


3) Not yet but close.

4)  page_num = logical_address >> OFFSET_BITS;
    offset = logical_address & OFFSET_MASK;


5) We implemented both FIFO and LRU. The user can select which
policy to use at the begining of the program. Detailed implemntation is inside
tlb.c

11.2)
1) Its pretty general because we can select replacement policy therefore
soluiton becomes extensible. All hard coded values are defined inside sytem.h
which can be modified in single spot.

2) It is very simple we have a system.h constant file where you define all
system related constant such as page table size.

3) yes

4) No. It is offset as framenum+offset, which are both equal in size since
frame number is the same size as page number.

11.3
1) It is as elegant as we can make it. We use different modules for related
funcions for readability and nothing is directly hardcoded. Constants are in
dedicated file and policies are separated from the mechanism.

2) It is not very innovative since we are only implementing simple replacement
policy and nothing thinking about loading from backing storage either on a
need basis or in a pre-fetching fashion.

3) We didnt use anything except what was provided by Dr.Qin on canvas, which
we didnt modify the comments that he put in with his name. All other files
without author info are made by us.
